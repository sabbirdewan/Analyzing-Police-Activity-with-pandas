Here I use pandas and matplotlib to find out the police activity of
Rhode Island. Clean the data and pre-process the data using different techniques. 
I worked like below: 

1. Preparing the data for analysis
2. Visual exploratory data analysis(EDA)
3. Exploring the relationship between gender and policing
4. Analyzing the effect of weather on policing
